Icon system using SVG sprite can be archived with the method described in this article: https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/

This polyfill's purpose is to fix a bug on Webkit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari and the like) that makes it unable to style icons with usual CSS.

There's no need for this on Firefox.
